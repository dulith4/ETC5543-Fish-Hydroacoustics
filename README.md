## BEFORE DOING INTIAL PULL PLEASE READ THIS,

THIS REPO's INTIAL DATASET IS CLOSE TO 60mb AS A RESULT OF THAT I HAVE USED GIT LFS TO STORE THE DATASET.
IF YOU ARE USING GIT LFS FOR THE FIRST TIME PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW.

First-time setup (once per computer, in git bash or terminal):

```bash
git lfs install
```

## Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone <REPO-URL>
cd ETC5543-Fish-Hydroacoustics
git lfs pull
```

**If you cloned before LFS was enabled (2025‑08‑10), please delete your local copy and reclone.**
